To push your new changes after making modifications to your project, you can follow these steps in Git:

1. **Check the status of your repository** (optional but useful):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Stage the changes** you want to commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   This command stages all the changes in your working directory. If you want to stage specific files, replace the `.` with the filenames.

3. **Commit the changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

4. **Push the changes** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you are working on (e.g., `main`, `master`, or your feature branch).

If you are on the correct branch already and have write access, the new changes will be pushed to the repository.
